CHDollar Programming Language is a modern Programming Language consists of JAVA OOPS, C# OOPS, 
Behave like CDOLLAR OOPS, GDOLLAR OOPS,used in Remote WebApplication , and Advanced OOPs. 
It is mainly used as a Remote Webapplication. It is used in case of Billing,Forms ,normal remotewebapplication , 
CH$-GRAPHICS ,and complex problems.

<u>What   is  the  difference   between Remotewebapplicationserver  and  webserver?</u>
  <br>


<u>Definition:  </u>

  Remote  webserver application    is   an  application    operates    with
  client-server.but  it  will  post  and  get  objects   from  server that  can  be
  
  exchanged through out  sessions  or  with  in   two   computers  ;  where   as   one  act   as  client
  
  and  other  act   as   server.
  


  eg)  When  you enter   details  using  CH$  program  that   creates   a   data  object
  
  called  as .dsn  file;  that can  be  exchanged  through  out   sessions.

<img  src="diagram.png"> 
  
  Difference  between   webserver  and  remoteserver  means   remotserver  
has   remote-client  connection  but  webserver don't have.
Data flow  is  unknown   using  J$  architecture.  where   as  in   
webserver  and  application server  like  tomcat,JSTAR SERVER,Jboss server,  etc;  here  dataflow  is  known.
JSTAR  webserver   is used   only   for  webdesign  so   we  don't  focus   remote webapplication with  high security.
JSTAR  is  focused  on normal    remote  webdesign.
In webserver  data  will   be   sent  between  client(browser)  and  server
is  known  to users.

so  this   indicates   webserver   has  no  security  but  remoteserver  using  J$  architecture
has  more   security  according  to  research.

Remoteserver   uses http +  socket  connection    where   as webserver uses   only  http  connection

Remote web  application server  =>  webserver  +  Applicationserver +  datasecurity.

So J$ is  most  advanced in  security   side. but  it  has  more  framework  and  latest technology

and  follows  shortest  code    than  any  technology and  including  advanced  business and  many  advantages

over  other  technologies. When  you  host   Jdollar  or  Chdollar  Servers   in  any  of  your   today

available   hosting   provider.  You   can   see  Jdollar  or   Chdollar   website   at  your  mobile phone

or  at  internet.


 <h1><u>ABOUT CHDOLLAR Programming Language</u></h1>
<p>
It is concenterated in building and designing Advanced Operating systems.
CH$ is invented in GDollar in year 2008.
CH stands for GAMMA and dollar stands for money.
So we called as GAMMA Technology.</p>
