### CHDollar ADvantages over JAVA and other Programming Languages 

A) CHDollar is the combination of C# , C/C++, and Advanced OOPS.
b) CHDollar will only accept the shortest attractive syntax.
c) CHDollar also used for construction of any datastructures.
d) it is easy to focus ,learn and use.
e) It also supports friendly function, pointers , and structures.
f) CHDollar support Virtual memmory and garbage collection.
g) It is efficient, fast and easy to understand, and it is a OOPS Technology.
h) CHDollar is a High level language.
i) CHDollar is highly portable language
j) Using CHDollar you can create any datastructures as libraries and use it in your Application program.
k) CHDollar language is a structured and object programming language.
l) CHDollar has OOPS concepts like JAVA.
m) CHDollar have the concept of Packages,etc.
n) CHDollar have the concept of constructor or destructor and had magic oops concepts.
o) It Support functions with Default Arguments
q) It Supports Exception handling
r) It have pointer and Nodes..
