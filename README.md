<BR> <U><B>CHDollar ADvantages over JAVA and other Programming Languages </b></u>
<BR><BR><BR>
A) CHDollar is the combination of C# , C/C++, and Advanced OOPS.<BR>
b) CHDollar will only accept the shortest attractive syntax.<BR>
c) CHDollar also used for construction of any datastructures.<BR>
d) it is easy to focus ,learn and use.<BR>
e) It also supports friendly function, pointers , and structures.<BR>
f) CHDollar support Virtual memmory and garbage collection.<BR>
g) It is efficient, fast and easy to understand, and it is a OOPS Technology.<BR>
h) CHDollar is a High level language.<BR>
i) CHDollar is highly portable language<BR>
j) Using CHDollar you can create any datastructures as libraries and use it in your Application program.<BR>
k) CHDollar language is a structured and object programming language.<BR>
l) CHDollar has OOPS concepts like JAVA.<BR>
m) CHDollar have the concept of Packages,etc.<BR>
n) CHDollar have the concept of constructor or destructor and had magic oops concepts.<BR>
o) It Support functions with Default Arguments<BR>
q) It Supports Exception handling<BR>
r) It have pointer and Nodes..<BR>
s) CHDollar is much simpler oops concepts, which leads to faster development and less mental overhead.<BR>
t) CHDollar is almost always explicitly compiled<BR>
u) CHDollar is easy to learn. CHDollar was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.CHDollar is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.<BR>
v) CHDollar creates .class, .exe or .dll files and it can be used with CHDollar main program. <BR>
w) CHDollar will compile and run at same time where other technology can't do<BR>
x) CHDollar is mainly used in complex programming , Billing the goods,Graphics,etc<BR>
y) CHDollar is used with OAKJAVA<BR>
z) CHDollar has Advanced OOPS like CDollar , and GDollar.<BR>
AA) CHDollar is an interactive Technology.<BR>
BB) CHDOLLAR is used as a remote webapplication<BR>
