<u>4WH Questions?</u>


</p>

<br>

<p>

<u>

 

 1) What  are  the  major  advantages  of   CH$  Programming  Language   ?
</u> </p>


CHDollar  Programming  Language   is  focused   mainly   on

   <li>Partially  Opensource
   <li>RemoteWebapplication-type-2
   <li>Good Security
   <li>Prototype

<p> <br>
<u>2) What are  the  Merits  and  disadvantages of  CH$ Programming Language?</u>

</p>


<u>Merits of CH$</u> <br>
 
<li>It is Good to create any compilers..and Advanced Operating systems and utilities.
<li>It has simpilified code
<li>It uses Pointers concept.
<li>CH$ also used with C@ and Arrow# in mobile and cloud computing.
<li>It  is     learnable  ,easy  to use, and   let  developers to  focus  only    c++or  C#  Programming  Language
<li>CH$  also    support   CHDOLLARAJAX

3) What  are   the  Advantages   of   CH$  Programming  Language?</u>

</p>
<br>



<u>CHDollar ADvantages over JAVA and other Programming Languages  </u>
<br>
A) CHDollar is the combination of  C# , C/C++, and Advanced OOPS.<br>
b) CHDollar will only accept the shortest attractive syntax.<br>
c) CHDollar also used for construction of any datastructures.<br>
d)  it  is   easy  to   focus  ,learn and  use.<br>
e) It also supports friendly function, pointers , and structures.<br>
f) CHDollar support Virtual memmory and garbage collection.<br>
g) It is efficient, fast and easy to understand, and it is a OOPS Technology.<br>
h) CHDollar is a High level language.<br>
i) CHDollar is highly portable language<br>
j) Using CHDollar you can create any datastructures as libraries and
use it in your Application program.<br>
k) CHDollar language is a structured and object programming language.<br>
l) CHDollar has OOPS concepts like JAVA.<br>
m) CHDollar have the concept of Packages,etc.<br>
n) CHDollar have the concept of constructor or destructor and had magic oops concepts.<br>
o) It Support functions with Default Arguments<br>
q) It Supports Exception handling<br>
r) It have pointer and Nodes..<br>
s) CHDollar is much simpler oops concepts, which leads to faster development and less mental overhead.<br>
t) CHDollar is almost always explicitly compiled<br>
u) CHDollar is easy to learn. CHDollar was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.CHDollar is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.<br>
v) CHDollar creates  .class,  .exe  or  .dll   files   and  it  can be  used  with   CHDollar  main  program.   <br>  
w) CHDollar will compile and run at same time where other technology can't
do<br>
x) CHDollar is mainly used in complex programming , Billing the
goods,Graphics,etc<br>
y)  CHDollar  is   used  with OAKJAVA<br>
z)  CHDollar   has   Advanced  OOPS  like  CDollar    ,  and  GDollar.<br>
AA) CHDollar is an interactive Technology.<br>
BB)  CHDOLLAR  is    used  as  a  remote  webapplication<br>

<br>

<p><u>


4)  What  are  the  advantages  of  CH$ P.L  over  JSTAR P.L? Why  we  focus  CHDollar? (Version1)  :  List  Out  Briefly:
 

</u>

</p>

<br>
<p>



</p>

CH$  is  used  in  variety  of  remote  webapplication  like  BILLING, FORMS,Reports, ATM  banking,  biometric,
Reservation  like  bus,train,cinema  ticket,etc.
Suppose  a   banking  customer  want  to  update  his  account  
in  banking  website..  That  data  or  information   is  stolen by   hackers..
SO  CHDollar  is   used   for  security  side  towards banking  and  finance  domain.
Since  we  already  know  the  fact  that if   you use  .exe or  .dbs   file  in  CHDollar  then
it  will   be  more  safe.. So  CHDollar is    focused  ....

for    every  month   software    will    be  updated    on   Tutorial website  not  on this   website.
This  Website   is  focused  only   for    Tutorial /Demos  /Samples  for   CH$ Programming language.

CH$  Enterprise  software    is  used   only   by  companies   and  IT  CLIENTS.
CH$   Enterprise   Software   contains   7  modules with complete  features of  CH$.

CH$  Enterprise   Software   is   available  with   Professionals /Enterprise  course.
Course   duration   is  upto  1 month  only.  +   CH$  Remote Webappilication Programming
Language   certification ] .  CH$  Enterprise  Software   is  not  opensource.

<br>

CHDollar  is  a  wide  topic focused  only   on  Proxy Remote  Webapplication  with  TYPE-2  (CLient  and  Server)...

<br>
There   are    7  modules   present  in  CHDollar...<br>

1)  CHDOLLAR-CH$ (used  for  normalremotewebapplication)(This module is included  in  CHDollar)<br>

2) CHDOLLAR-chdollar-J$-ATM BANKING(This module is included  in  CHDollar)<br>

(This module is included  in  CHDollar)<br>

4)  CHDOLLAR-JWP (used  for  Reservation based  projects )<br>

(This module is included  in  CHDollar)<br>

5)  CHDOLLAR  with  JDollar(JWEB)  Technology...(Here  JDollar(JWEB)  is  focused)<br>

(This module is included  in  CHDollar)<br>

6)  It  is  used  with  C@  and  Arrow# -  Manufacturing  and  statistics domain<br>

(This module is not included in  CHDollar;  you  can  see  more  detail  at  C@  and  Arrow#)<br>

7)  CHDOLLAR  with  CDollar,Gdollar  (OnlineBills , forms,reports)(we can  use  C# Technology)<br>

(This module is included  in  CHDollar).<br>
